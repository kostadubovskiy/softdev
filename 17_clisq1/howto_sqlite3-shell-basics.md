 If the named file does not exist, a new database file with the given name will be created automatically.
If no database file is specified on the command-line, a temporary database is created and automatically deleted when the "sqlite3" program exits. 
SELECT name FROM tpotusa WHERE id = 0; # where id is the type cast name in the creation of the database
cont # and name is the key
