K33 -- Bubbles and  Captures
2023-04-27

# Bubble Phase
This is when event handlers are called from the event-origin element, basically the priority ranking "bubbles up" from the event. High specificity(element) --> High generality(document)

# Capture Phase
This is the opposite of bubbling up, it "captures" the element where the event took place from the top down.
