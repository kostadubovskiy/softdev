# **Flask For Static Files**
## **Roster:** Elizabeth Paperno, Raven (Ruiwen) Tang, William Vongphanith, Kosta Dubovskiy

## **Notes:**
* If the file has a html extension the server will be created and display on the webpage how the html normally would.
* If a file does not have an extension its contents will either be displayed or the file will attempt to be downloaded. This behavior varies based on the browser used.  
* You can use localhost as opposed to an IP address.
* The file path follows the same path as the directory where app is routed.
