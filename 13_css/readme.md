# Notes n disco

CSS does not throw errors just does not work, very annoying

There are hierarchies, top hierarchy is if the style is defined inline (inside html)

There are so many attributes in css that the internet is necessary
    * justify-items
    * align-items
    * line-height

# QCC

Will flask affect anything relating to css?
